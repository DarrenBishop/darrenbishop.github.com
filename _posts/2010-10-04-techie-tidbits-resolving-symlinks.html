If you use a linux distro that uses the alternatives framework, from time to time you might need to know where or what those symlinks eventually point to; this was the case for me when I needed to know where my JRE home was... and <code>which java</code> wasn't helping me (much).

Google introduced me to <code>readlink</code> which has an <code>-e</code> or <code>-f</code> option which basically switches on recursion.

So something like <code>readlink -f `which java`</code> told me what I needed to know.

I went a step further and created two aliases in my <code>~/.bash_aliases</code> file (sourced from <code>~/.bashrc</code>), like so:

<pre class="brush: bash">
alias rle='readlink -e'
alias rlf='readlink -f'
</pre>

So <code>rlf `which java`</code> saves you 7 key presses.

All things considered the speed up is probably going to be marginal, but everything helps right?
