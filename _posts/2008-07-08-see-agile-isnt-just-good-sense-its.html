In my view, Agile does not claim ownership of any of it's principles, practices or techniques; rather it <i>advocates</i> doing certain things to help make improvements.

So it follows that a lot of this stuff can be applied in situations other than cutting-code or delivering software.

That said, the findings in the <a href="http://www.orgnet.com/email.html">linked article</a> come at no surprise. Agile treats <i>good, continuous communication</i> as a core axiom. The discovery of this importance in another (albeit undisclosed, yet seemingly IT related) field suggests the good sense in <b><i>Agile is common sense for EVERYONE</i></b>.
