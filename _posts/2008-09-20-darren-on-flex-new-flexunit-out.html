FlexUnit-0.9 has been released by Adobe Cosulting.

I believe this is the first release since the projects move from Google Code to <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexunit/FlexUnit">Adobe open Source</a>.
I have browsed the source code and nothing seems to have changed; obviously, community, please can correct me if I am wrong.

There is still a lingering reference to the <code>flexunit.extensions.TestSetup</code> class which is still nowhere to be seen. Indeed I discovered the update while trying to find the standard approach to test-suite setup and teardown; subquently deciding it is is not the solution to my problem anyway.

The most significant change, if only change, is the UI. We have:
<ul>
<li><b>An active search filter</b> that narrows down the displayed list of test methods, matching on test (method) name.</li>
<li><b>A combobox with three result options</b>: <b>All Results</b>, <b>Empty Tests</b> and <b>Failures &amp; errors</b>; this replaces the tabbed view in the old version.</li>
<li><b>A red cross or green tick</b> indicating the obvious, with a fat red cross or green tick to indicate overall (test-suite) pass or failure; it's a sad day - we've lost our beloved red-bar-green-bar.</li>
<li><b>In the event of an error/failure, improved diagnostic feedback.</b> Just the other day I was getting frustrated with the old version, scrolling through the stack trace to find what class and which line of code <i>I wrote</i> (as opposed to FlexUnit code) that caused the breakage; well, it seems I won't have to suffer that anymore.</li>
</ul>Overall, it just looks a lot more charming.

Check it out, literally.
