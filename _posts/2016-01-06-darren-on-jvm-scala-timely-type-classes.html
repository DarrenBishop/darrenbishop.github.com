<p>For those of you who have ever done any Ruby development on Rails super-charged with ActiveRecord (as I recall back from 2008), you would have been blessed with the most intuitive date-arithmetic facility known to programming-man.</p>
<p>At that time in my life, Java was my main bread-and-butter and I longed for this simplicity… I am sure we all did.</p>
<p>Why it did not exist was simple: primitives such as <code>int</code> and <code>String</code> had these binary operators, as supported by the Java language, but of course Objects like <code>java.util.Date</code> did not; to get them would obviously require a change to the language, but where would you draw the line? What would be the default <code>java.lang.Object</code> behaviour in a <code>obj1 + obj2 = ???</code> situation?</p>
<p>Then came a long Scala: read <strong><em>‘…change in the language’</em></strong> becomes <strong><em>‘… change the language’</em></strong></p>
<h2 class="pagebreak">Writing Without Punctuation</h2>
<p>Before getting into the main meat of this post, let’s digress for a moment to recall another cool and important feature of Scala.</p>
<p>We know binary operators in Scala are just single-parameter functions in disguise. So flipping that on its head, we can use single-parameter functions like operators:</p>
<pre class=" brush: scala">"Scala" concat "Is" concat "The" concat "Bees" concat "Knees"
</pre>
<p>is exactly the same as</p>
<pre class=" brush: scala">"Scala".concat("Is".concat("The".concat("Bees".concat("Knees"))))
</pre>
<p>Try them both in <code>sbt console</code></p>
<p>There are some quirks and special steps to be taken if intermixing alphanumeric characters and symbols in your function names, but you get the gist.</p>
<p>So basically Scala allows us to remove <em>punctuation</em> around function invocations, when those functions are single-parameter functions; you can still remove the <strong>.</strong> (dot) in invocations of functions with multiple parameters, but the parentheses are still required (…why? Off topic!)</p>
<p>Now exposing binary operators for what they, it stands to reason they can be overriden… or more importantly, can be defined where once they were not.</p>
<h2 class="pagebreak"><em>Extension Methods</em> a.k.a. Implicits</h2>
<p>Extension methods are a language feature I discovered when consulting on a C# project Germany many years ago. I remember thinking how cool they were back then and still think they are awesome now in Scala.</p>
<p>Other languages support this feature in their own form too: Ruby has monkey-patching and JavaScript has prototype augmentation. I suppose if you are really desperate for this facility in Java, one can introduce Aspects.</p>
<p>Of course in Scala they are merely an application of implicits, or more accurately, the use of implicit type-conversion.</p>
<pre class=" brush: scala">// Runnable in 'sbt console'
import java.util.Date

implicit class SuperfluousDate(date: Date) {

  def someSuperfluousFunction = date.toString
}

case class UnimaginableDate(date:Date) {

  def someUnimaginableFunction = date.toString
}

implicit def toTheUnimaginable(date:Date) = UnimaginableDate(date)

val now = new Date

now.someSuperfluousFunction

now.someUnimaginableFunction
</pre>
<p>As with C# and Extension Methods, one needs to be careful with how implicit type-conversion is applied, so to preserve the semantic/conceptual/behavioural integrity of the class being extended.</p>
<h2 class="pagebreak">Type Classes a.k.a. Implicits²</h2>
<p>Type classes are a powerful feature that allows Scala developers to define an <em>interface</em> to capture the behaviour to be added to a class. That type-class can then be used to declare dependencies and expectations in other classes.</p>
<p>An out-of-the-box example of this is Scala’s <code>Ordering[T]</code> trait: collections have both <code>min()</code> and <code>max()</code>  functions, for example; they only work for the collection, say of type <code>List[A]</code>, if  there is an implementation of <code>Ordering[A]</code> in implicit scope.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>  type-classes are typically defined as traits and are always parametric, that is, they are defined with a parameter type, <code>[T]</code>; they typically have many - at least one, to be useful - concrete implementations that are case-objects and specify <code>[T]</code>.<br>
This is a key difference of the application of simple extension methods, which require a concrete class, as above, that is not a case-object and can work without parameter-types.</p>
<p>The function definitions therein also differ, where it is typical in type-classes to define the first parameter as the <em>this</em> object of the function.</p>
<pre class=" brush: scala">// ...continued
trait Chrono[T] {

  def now: T
  def toMillis(t: T): Long
  def fromMillis(millis: Long): T
  def -(t: T, duration: FiniteDuration): T
  def +(t: T, duration: FiniteDuration): T
}

implicit case object DateChrono extends Chrono[Date] {

  def now = fromMillis(System.currentTimeMillis())
  def toMillis(date: Date) = date.getTime
  def fromMillis(millis: Long) = new Date(millis)
  def -(date: Date, duration: FiniteDuration): Date = new Date(date.getTime - duration.toMillis)
  def +(date: Date, duration: FiniteDuration): Date = new Date(date.getTime + duration.toMillis)
}
</pre>
<p>As you can see, the type-class <code>Chrono[T]</code> is parametric in <code>[T]</code> and the concrete case-object  implementation, <code>DateChrono</code>, specifies <code>[T]</code> to be <code>[Date]</code>.</p>
<p>The usefulness of this is perhaps still not apparent</p>
<pre class=" brush: scala">// ...continued
import scala.concurrent.duration.{FiniteDuration, DAYS}

val later = DateChrono.+(now, FiniteDuration(10, DAYS))

later.someUnimaginableFunction
</pre>
<h2 class="pagebreak">Implicits * (1 + Implicits)</h2>
<p>Now we combine the basic implicits, as used to implement extensions methods, with the advanced implicits, to define type-classes, to give us the ActiveRecord-style data-arithmetic  sugary goodness</p>
<pre class=" brush: scala">// ...continued
implicit class ChronoArithmetic[T](t: T)(implicit ev: Chrono[T]) {

  def plus(duration: FiniteDuration) = ev.+(t, duration)
  def +(duration: FiniteDuration) = plus(duration)
  def minus(duration: FiniteDuration) = ev.-(t, duration)
  def -(duration: FiniteDuration) = minus(duration)
}

now + FiniteDuration(10, DAYS)
</pre>
<p>and more sugar</p>
<pre class=" brush: scala">// ...continued
val days20 = FiniteDuration(20, DAYS)

now + days20
</pre>
<p>and yet more SUGGGAAAARRR</p>
<pre class=" brush: scala">// ...continued
import scala.concurrent.duration._

now + 30.days
</pre>
<p>How cool is that!</p>
<p>Perhaps there was a bit of a leap there: deciphering <code>ChronoArithmetic</code>, it offers an implicit conversion of instances of type <code>[T]</code> but only where there is an implementation of <code>Chrono[T]</code> available in implicit scope.</p>
<p>It doesn’t end there…</p>
<h2 class="pagebreak">Testing With ChronoTime</h2>
<p>Now you may wonder how this applies to testing: have you ever been in the situation where you wanted to set when <strong><em>now</em></strong> is?</p>
<p>Say in a batch of time sensitive tests, by virtue of covering time sensitive production code, where you must have the test code and the production code reliably agree on when <em>now</em> is, down to the microsecond.</p>
<p>You can’t monkey around with the system time as that will break with parallelized testing… and probably break a whole bunch of other things.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/">Joda-Time</a> offers a mechanism to do this with <a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/DateTimeUtils.html#setCurrentMillisFixed-long-">DateTimeUtils.setCurrentMillisFixed(long)</a>, made thread-safe with <a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/DateTimeUtils.html#setCurrentMillisProvider-org.joda.time.DateTimeUtils.MillisProvider-">DateTimeUtils.setCurrentMillisProvider(DateTimeUtils.MillisProvider millisProvider)</a> … which is cool if you are already using Joda-Time and can ensure that all past and future requests for the current time is made via <a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/DateTimeUtils.html#currentTimeMillis--">DateTimeUtils.currentTimeMillis()</a> and not the typical <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/System.html?is-external=true#currentTimeMillis--">System.currentTimeMillis()</a>.</p>
<p>An old colleague of mine faced this exact problem and enhanced the implementation with a clock!</p>
<pre class=" brush: scala">// ...continued
trait Clock {
  def millis: Long
}
</pre>
<p>Now this is essentially the same as <a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/DateTimeUtils.MillisProvider.html">DateTimeUtils.MillisProvider</a>. Originally, the API was updated such that an instance of this <code>Clock</code> was <em>explicitly</em> passed around wherever <em>now</em> was needed.</p>
<pre class=" brush: scala">// ...continued... but hold off pasting this in
trait Chrono[T] {
  def now(clock: Clock) = fromMillis(clock.millis)
  ...
}

def rightNow[T](clock: Clock)(implicit ev: Chrono[T]): T = ev.now(clock)
</pre>
<p>It seemed a shame to litter the API with the introduction of this new <code>Clock</code> class, but that was easily remedied by making it implicit also.</p>
<pre class=" brush: scala">// ...continued... go ahead and paste this in (update Chrono[T])
trait Chrono[T] {
  def now(implicit clock: Clock) = fromMillis(clock.millis)
  ...
}

def rightNow[T](implicit ev: Chrono[T], clock: Clock): T = ev.now
</pre>
<p>The implementation of <code>now(...)</code> is now (ha) completed provided by <code>Chrono[T]</code>; it is no longer an abstract method and can be removed from all type-classes, such as <code>DateChrono</code>.</p>
<p>Notice how implicit parameters are automatically in implicit scope for invocations made inside the function body; this has the effect that implicit parameters get passed along.</p>
<p>Another quick digression to bring to mind another cool feature of Scala and application of it.</p>
<h4 id="have-your-slice-of-cake">Have Your Slice of Cake</h4>
<p>In Scala, it is very common to implement the <a href="http://jonasboner.com/2008/10/06/real-world-scala-dependency-injection-di/">Cake pattern</a> and compose the execution environment with layers, whether that be the production execution environment or the test execution environment.</p>
<p>The Cake pattern is made possible by Scala’s Traits language feature.<br>
In some ways Scala Traits are similar to Aspects in Java. That said, I have only ever seen Aspects used to augment behaviour; Scala Traits can mixin behaviour <em>AND</em> mixin state - the latter along with Scala’s <code>self-type</code> are utilised in implementing the Cake pattern.</p>
<p>The Cake pattern and layering is really beneficial in that it provides an environment and object-graph that is type-checkable at compile-time; compare that to the dynamic nature of Spring-powered dependency-injection – you know if the Scala + Cake compiles, all dependencies are satisfied.</p>
<h4 id="execution-environments">Execution Environments</h4>
<p>Lets introduce a <code>Clock</code> implementation that defers to the system time</p>
<pre class=" brush: scala">// ...continued
trait ClockProvider {

  implicit val clock: Clock
}

case object SystemClock extends Clock {
  def millis = {
    System.currentTimeMillis
  }
}

trait SystemClockProvider extends ClockProvider {

  implicit val clock = SystemClock
}
</pre>
<p>This implementation can be used to compose an object graph in a production environment</p>
<pre class=" brush: scala">// ...continued
class Main extends SystemClockProvider {
  self: ClockProvider =&gt;

  val now: Date = rightNow[Date]
}

val then = new Main().now

val later = then + 20.days
</pre>
<p>For testing, we can provide an alternate implementation that always returns the same value</p>
<pre class=" brush: scala">// ...continued
class Production(implicit clock: Clock) {

  println(clock.getClass)
  
  def get5SecondsLater = rightNow[Date] + 5.seconds
}

case object FixedClock extends Clock {
  def millis = {
    0 // since Unix Epoch, 1st January 1970
  }
}

class FixedClockTest extends FixedClockProvider {
  self: ClockProvider =&gt;
  
  val later5Seconds = rightNow[Date] + 5.seconds
  
  val prod = new Production

  assert(prod.get5SecondsLater == later5Seconds, "FAIL")
}

new FixedClockTest
</pre>
<p>Here’s a negative test using the <code>SystemClock</code></p>
<pre class=" brush: scala">// ...continued
class SystemClockTest extends SystemClockProvider {
  self: ClockProvider =&gt;
  
  val later5Seconds = rightNow[Date] + 5.seconds
  
  println("Sleeping...")
  
  Thread.sleep(5000)
  
  val prod = new Production

  val prodLater = prod.get5SecondsLater
  
  assert(prodLater != later5Seconds, "FAIL")
}

new SystemClockTest
</pre>
<p>That’s about it.</p>
