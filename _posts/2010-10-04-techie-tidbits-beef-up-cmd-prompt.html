Are you a frequent Cygwin user and/or often ask yourself "Why is the CMD prompt so crap?!"? If so, you'll probably be interested to know how you can inject some or possibly all of that Linux/Bash goodness into your CMD prompt.

<h5>1st, <a href="http://blog.darrenbishop.co.uk/2010/10/techie-tidbits-get-going-with-cygwin.html">Install Cygwin</a> if you haven't already done so</h5>

<h5>2nd, Extend Your <code>PATH</code></h5>
Create a <code>bin</code> (short for binary, but conventionally the home for anything executable) folder in your user directory, then add this directory to your <code>PATH</code> variable: <em>Win+Pause > Advanced Settings > Environment Variables</em>, probably best to add it to <em>User variables for &lt;You&gt;</em>

<h5>3rd, Create Your Associations</h5>
I've made an <code>associations.cmd</code> file in my personal <code>bin</code> directory with the following contents:
<pre class="brush: bash">
@echo off

assoc .sh=BashScript
ftype BashScript="C:\Cygwin\bin\env.exe" "CYGWIN=nodosfilewarning" "/bin/bash" -l "%%1" %%*

assoc .pl=PerlScript
ftype PerlScript="C:\Cygwin\bin\env.exe" "CYGWIN=nodosfilewarning" "/bin/perl" "%%1" %%*

assoc .py=PythonScript
ftype PythonScript="C:\Dev\Python\2.6(x86)\python.exe" "%%1" %%*

assoc .rb=RubyScript
ftype RubyScript="C:\Dev\Ruby\1.8.6\bin\ruby.exe" "%%1" %%*
</pre>

Clearly I have Python and Ruby installed on Windows - if you don't omit the last and second to last command pairs. If you have installed the Perl package in Cygwin (which I recommend you do), then the second pair of commands wires that up. Now run this CMD file.

<h5>4th, Extend Your <code>PATHEXT</code></h5>
Follow the instructions in step 2, but instead of changing the <code>PATH</code> variable, add the Bash, Python and Perl script file extensions (SH, PY and PL, respectively) to the semi-colon separated <code>PATHEXT</code> variable

<p>
This now allows you to run any Bash, Python or Perl script from anywhere on the CMD Prompt, JOY!

<h5>A Perl Example</h5>
Create <code>prename.pl</code> in your personal <code>bin</code> directory with the following contents:
<pre class="brush: perl">
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

$op = shift or die "Usage: rename expr [files]\n";
chomp(@ARGV = <STDIN>) unless @ARGV;
for (@ARGV) {
    $was = $_;
    eval $op;
    die $@ if $@;
    rename($was,$_) unless $was eq $_;
}
</pre>

<p>
Now if you have a file called <code>file_123.txt</code> and you wanted to rename it to <code>file_abc.txt</code>, you could run the following in a CMD Prompt:
<pre class="brush: bash">
prename "s,\d+,abc," file*
</pre>
