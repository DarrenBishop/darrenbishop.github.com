Installing Cygwin is a pretty straight forward exercise - but here I walk-through a few extra configuration steps that make Cygwin a real productivity catalyst for my day-to-day activities.

<h5>1st, Install Cygwin</h5>
Download the <code>setup.exe</code> file from <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe">here</a>. I usually install to <code>C:\Cygwin</code> and stick all the package stuff in <code>C:\Cygwin\.pkg</code>, where I also stick the <code>setup.exe</code>, once I've initially finished with it.

<h5>2nd, relocate <code>/home</code></h5>
Following any install or update, I always start up a shell and remove the <code>/home</code> directory and symlink to <code>C:\Documents and Settings</code> (this some how still works on Win 7, but we could easily use <code>C:\Users</code>):
<pre class="brush: bash">
cd /
rm -fr home
ln -s "C:\Documents and Settings" home
</pre>
This now relieves you of having to maintain two home directories - after a while of using Cygwin you'll start to wonder why they didn't do this automatically.

<h5>3rd, add some <em>Bash Here</em> action</h5>
Cygwin has a wealth of command-line tools for text processing; that's great - I find these immensely useful when tweaking configuration files or batch processing server log files, for Apache say.
The annoying bit is getting a shell open in the directory where you need to go to work: cue <em>Chere</em>!
<p>
In the <em>Select Packages</em> screen, search for and install both <code>chere</code> and <code>mintty</code> packages. If you happen to be reading this through once first, you can go ahead and do this step when you first install Cygwin (in step 1).
<p>
Now fire up a shell and enter the following command;
<pre class="brush: bash">
chere -ia1 -t mintty -s bash -e 'Bash Here'
</pre>
Now you should be able to right click on any directory in Windows Explorer and have a <em>Bash Here</em> option

<h5>4th, spin up SSHD (skip this if you're asking 'What's SSHD?')</h5>
Errm, actually, I'll save this for another blog...
