<h3>ZA.com</h3>
<p>For this series we focus on performance testing a flight booking
and flight checking applications of a system for a fictitious company
called <i>ZA.com</i>.</p>
<p>The key performance indicator (KPI) i.e. metric, for the booking
application is booked flights. A significant feature of this application
will be a flight booking workflow: to book a flight one would need to
fill out a series of forms; only a completed workflow, with valid data,
constitutes a successful booking. Errors in workflow completion will not
count in the throughput calculation of booked flights</p>
<p>The KPI for the flight checking application will be successful
flight status checks. There is no workflow in this application.</p>
<p>I will go into more detail on the booking workflow in the next
post. The remainder of this post will explorer what JMeter provides for
testing such a system. We have established so far that the workflow will
be supported by HTML forms, thus the performance testing will target the
web-application layer.</p>

<h3>JMeter Basics</h3>
<p>JMeter test-plans are hierarchical in structure and require a
base set of nodes, called test-elements, to do anything useful. This set
includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A (single) test-plan element, which is the root node</li>
    <li>A thread-group element, a child of the test-plan element</li>
    <li>A sampler element, a child of the thread-group element</li>
    <li>A listener element, a child of the thread-group element</li>
</ul>
<h4>Test Plans</h4>
<p>The hierarchical structure of a test plan serves to define the
scope-of-influence of sub-ordinate test-elements. Consider the following
test-plan configuration:</p>
<ul>
    <li>test-plan
    <ul>
        <li>thread-group
        <ul>
            <li>sampler-1
            <ul>
                <li>listener-grand-child</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>sampler-2</li>
            <li>listener-child</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>listener-sibling</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Both listener-child and listener-sibling will <i>hear</i> samples
from both sample-1 and sampler-2. However, listener-grand-child will
only hear samples from sampler-1.</p>

<h4>Thread Groups</h4>
<p>These provide a basis for concurrent activity in your test-plan.
When running a simple test-plan, such as the one described above, each
thread will basically carry-out the actions as specified by the
thread-group's sampler descendant elements. Complex test-plans, however,
introduce test-elements that will affect the activity of these threads;
it is this flexibility that yields the potential to do interesting
things with JMeter.</p>

<p>Threads are typically utilised as surrogate-users, performing the
work of the 10's, 100's, 1000's (or so however many) disparate users in
a real i.e. production, deployment of the system. There is essentially
two ways to utilise threads in JMeter: one thread per surrogate user,
where the thread dies when the work for that user is done; or one thread
per <i>n</i>-users, where <i>a thread's work is never done</i>, at least
not until it's finished sequentially performing the work of its
allocated users.</p>

<p>You can specify as much thread-groups and as much threads (total,
across all thread-groups) as your test infrastructure can support. A
quick study will be carried out to see how many threads JMeter can put
to use before system integrity is compromised.</p>

<h4>Samplers</h4>
<p>Where threads in thread-groups do the work, samplers are the work
that gets done. They are called such as they take a sample reading
against the system, producing a datum; the data thus collected over the
course of a test is used to make some assertion on the system's
functional correctness or performance.</p>

<p>There are many types of samplers, but two will be mostly used
here:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The HTTPRequest sampler, the HTTPClient variant, which will
    be used to invoke the applications</li>
    <li>The JMS Subscriber sampler, which will be used to detect
    flight booking transactions</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternative tools will be used to assert the functional
correctness of the applications: the samplers used will thus omit any
functional information in the sample readings; only timing related data
will be gathered. This permits orders of magnitude more samplers to be
taken, with comparable memory usage, allowing for much longer running
tests. <b>Longer running tests have greater potential to identify
emergent defects caused by memory leaks.</b></p>

<p>Incidentally, samplers present the best opportunity to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself" target="_blank">DRY</a> you test-plans. For example, a workflow
implemented in HTML forms will require a sequence of HTTP requests;
these will only differ in the HTTP request parameters. All other details
such as host, port, base url, even authentication details will typically
remain the same. The JMeter mechanisms to refactor these details will be
presented in the coming sections.</p>

<h4>Listeners</h4>
<p>Where threads and samplers gather sample data, listeners
post-process that data, non-destructively, in varying ways. Most have a
logging capability; some in fact only have a logging capability. More
complex listeners do statistical analysis, the result of maybe graphed
and/or logged.</p>

<p>It is very important to note that some of the <i>statistical</i>-listeners
need to maintain copies of the gathered samples to be able to update
their statistically derived values; also different listeners maybe do
this at the same time. If your intention is to carry out high-volume
sampling, these statistical-listeners should not be used during a live
test run. These listeners can quite easily be used <i>offline</i> to
post-process the test results i.e. once the test has run to completion
and all raw data has been collected.</p>

<h3>Web Testing with JMeter</h3>
<p>As mentioned, HTTPRequest samplers are used to implement tests
that target web applications. The use of this particular sampler is most
appropriate for invoking web-applications that have a HTML
user-interface. It is also a good match for RESTful web-services that
provide HTML interfaces or that produce xml data.</p>

<p>RESTful web-servies and HTML-producing web-applications are of
relevance here, less due to what they produce, but more due to the fact
that they consume HTTP request parameters as input to their function.
Such applications operate at the HTTP protocol level: most other
web-services e.g. SOAP based, use HTTP only as an envelope protocol i.e.
to exploit port-80 to traverse firewalls; they do not themselves use
HTTP request parameters, or at least the use of such is made completely
opaque to the user, surrogate or otherwise.</p>

<p>When configuring a HTTPRequest sampler, you typically specify:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Server, hostname or IP address</li>
    <li>Port, default 80</li>
    <li>Protocol, default HTTP</li>
    <li>Method, default GET</li>
    <li>Encoding</li>
    <li>Path</li>
    <li>Request parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these items can be refactored.</p>

<h4>Refactoring Web Tests</h4>
<p>Imagine a third web-application for ZA.com that allows frequent
flyer members to check their airmiles. To check one's airmiles is a
two-step process: first navigate to the web-application's homepage; then
input your frequent flyer membership number and password to login. After
taking these steps, the application will display your accrued airmiles
and a history of all your flights, along with the airmiles earned from
each.</p>

<p>This workflow specifies two HTTP requests i.e. to get to the
login page and to subsequently login. All the details of the first
request could potentially be identical to those of the second, barring
the URL-path and maybe the protocol. The following pictures illustrate
how these requests might be setup in JMeter and make clear the
duplication of detail.</p>

<table class="image" align="center">
    <tr>
        <td>
        <table class="image">
            <caption align="bottom">Figure 1: Homepage step</caption>
            <tr>
                <td><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"
                    href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Q_F_ea5EKi0/SiFtj2NwB3I/AAAAAAAAAFM/_cNTePGUuFI/s1600-h/airmiles_navigate_to_homepage.png"><img style="margin: 0 10px 10px 0; cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 400px; height: 194px;" rc="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Q_F_ea5EKi0/SiFtj2NwB3I/AAAAAAAAAFM/_cNTePGUuFI/s400/airmiles_navigate_to_homepage.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5341671095654156146" /></a></td>
            </tr>

        </td>
        <td>
        <table class="image">
            <caption align="bottom">Figure 2: Login step</caption>
            <tr>
                <td><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Q_F_ea5EKi0/SiF-vdoMAcI/AAAAAAAAAFk/VZ1v4bTdzyU/s1600-h/airmiles_login.png"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 400px; height: 198px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Q_F_ea5EKi0/SiF-vdoMAcI/AAAAAAAAAFk/VZ1v4bTdzyU/s400/airmiles_login.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5341689986910257602" /></a></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>JMeter additionally provides config-elements, one of which is the
HTTP Request Defaults config-element. All details repeated in any of the
samplers should be removed and placed in HTTP Request Defaults
config-element; the usually scoping rules apply. The following figures
illustrate this re-configuration.</p>

<p>Configuring DRY tests like this gives you the usual benefits
while not incurring any readability penalty; DRY tests are much easier
to maintain and update in the event you switch port numbers or protocols,
etc. It might seem academic for the given example but maintaining a longer
workflow, with 30 steps for instance, becomes much more manageable.</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that JMeter test-plans i.e. the <code>.jmx</code>
files, are formatted in XML; they are just text so you can go to work on
them using any <i>find'n'replace</i> tool - just be careful to preserve
the well-formedness and validness of the file.</p>

<h3>Parameterizing JMeter Test Plans</h3>
<p></p>

<h4>Remember:</h4>
<p>If user-defined variables are used or if variables are injected
from CSV files and you want to include them in sample results, you must
amend the <em>jmeter.properties</em> file by specifying <code>sample_variables=[comma,separated,list,of,variable,names,to,include]</code>;
search for <i>sample_variables</i> in this file and amend accordingly.</p>
